# Jupyter notebook markdown generator

This .ipynb file is Jupyter notebook file that converts a TSV containing structured data about publications (`publications.tsv`) into individual markdown file that will be properly formatted for the website. The notebook contains a lot of documentation about the process. The .py file is pure python that do the same things if it is executed in a terminal, it just doesn't have pretty documentation.
